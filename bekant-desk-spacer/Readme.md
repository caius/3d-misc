# Bekant Desk Spacer

I have an Ikea Bekant sit/stand desk which gradually slides backwards until it's touching the wall. Raising it up then scrapes the wall if I haven't noticed and pulled it forwards in time.

This is a spacer to be printed twice (once for each leg) which goes between the back of the foot and the wall to prevent this.
